# Elixir Api Exercise

## Exercise 1 - Playing with the Phoenix defaults

### 1a Creating the app

We're going to start by creating a new Phoenix app in this umbrella application and understanding all the awesome boilerplate that comes with it.

Start by cloning this repo, and navigating to the root.

```
git clone https://github.com/developess/build_a_phoenix_api.git

cd build_a_phoenix_api
```

Since this is an umbrella application, we want to move to the `apps` folder to create a new app under the umbrella. I'm calling my app `fawkes` because this is a throwaway app and it will stand out when we're looking around (plus he's the OG phoenix). **Don't** name your app something generic that you may see in code like 'Test' or 'Elixir' as you'll just confuse yourself!

From the project root, run:

```
cd apps

mix phx.new fawkes --no-ecto --no-webpack
```

`mix phx.new` creates a new phoenix app in the umbrella.

The flags `--no-ecto` and `--no-webpack` reduce some of the boilerplate that comes with phoenix, providing just the skeleton app for this example. Ecto is a database wrapper and webpack is for compiling front end code - we don't need this for now.

Select `Y` to fetch and install dependencies when prompted.

If dependencies don't install properly, you may not have a recent version of hex or phoenix downloaded. Try running `mix local.hex` and installing deps again with `mix deps.get`. Still having issues? Check the [phoenix installation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html).

Now let's start this new phoenix app using `mix phx.server`:

```
cd fawkes

mix phx.server
```

With your server up and running, check out the app at `localhost:4000`

If you can see a web page, then ðŸŽ‰ you just made a server.

Now, lets dig into the code and work out how this app was created.

### 1b Adding a new page

Your newly created file structure (in `apps/fawkes`) should look something like the below. The key folder here is the `lib` folder, which holds your application files (equivalent of `src` in other languages).

Inside `lib` should be 2 more folders: `fawkes` and `fawkes_web`. We're interested in `fawkes_web` as that holds the majority of the setup files for the web server. `fawkes` just holds an application file which starts the server in a process.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ config
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fawkes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fawkes_web
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fawkes.ex
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fawkes_web.ex
â”œâ”€â”€ priv
â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

Inside `fawkes_web` our file structure looks like this:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ channels
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ user_socket.ex
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ page_controller.ex
â”œâ”€â”€ templates
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ layout
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ app.html.eex
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ page
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.html.eex
â””â”€â”€ views
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ error_helpers.ex
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ error_view.ex
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ layout_view.ex
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ page_view.ex
â”œâ”€â”€ endpoint.ex
â”œâ”€â”€ gettext.ex
â”œâ”€â”€ router.ex

```

As you might recognise, Phoenix has set up a classic "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) pattern for us. I won't dive into the merits of this pattern here, but it provides a useful scaffold to make sense of all these files!

Open up `router.ex`. The router is often the heart of a web server and is a useful place to start.

```elixir
defmodule FawkesWeb.Router do
  use FawkesWeb, :router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ["html"]
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
    plug :put_secure_browser_headers
  end

  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
  end

  scope "/", FawkesWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", PageController, :index
  end

  # Other scopes may use custom stacks.
  # scope "/api", FawkesWeb do
  #   pipe_through :api
  # end
end
```

Routes map unique HTTP verb/path pairs to controller/action pairs which will handle them. The page that you saw when you opened up `localhost:4000` is created by this line:

```elixir
get "/", PageController, :index
```

Here, `get` is our HTTP verb - a get request. `"/"` is the path, the url at which we're serving the resouce. `PageController` is the name of a module in our controllers directory that returns the resource, and `:index` is the action - and corresponds to a function called index in the `PageController` controller.

Let's look inside the `controllers` directory in `page_controller.ex`. You'll see the index function that returns the resource:

```elixir
defmodule FawkesWeb.PageController do
  use FawkesWeb, :controller

  def index(conn, _params) do
    render(conn, "index.html")
  end
end
```

How does this work? `conn` is short for `connection` - its kind of equivalent to the `(req, res)` you might get in Node.js. `render` is a function afforded to us by the controller macro, which is imported at the top:

```elixir
use FawkesWeb, :controller
```

But where does `"index.html"` come from? Well, Phoenix is pretty smart and is set up to look in the `/templates` directory for the templates it renders. `index.html` matches the `index.html.eex` template we can see in the template folder, which you'll see matches the webpage you saw at `localhost:4000`

Now we understand _roughly_ how that page was served up, but there's still more to learn.

**Let's add a new page to the app**

In `router.ex` add a new route.

```elixir
get "/magic", MagicController, :index
```

Since we're using a new controller, let's create a new file in the `controllers` directory.

```elixir
defmodule FawkesWeb.MagicController do
  use FawkesWeb, :controller

  def index(conn, _params) do
    render(conn, "magic.html")
  end
end
```

We're making a new template too. Let's make it super simple. Add a file to `/templates` called `magic.html.eex` and add the following code:

```html
<div class="phx-hero">
  <h2>Accio Brain!</h2>
</div>
```

Feel free to spice things up and insert your own favourite Harry Potter quote.

Pointing our browser to `http://localhost:4000/magic`, we should be able to see our own greeting from Phoenix! (if you stopped the server in an earlier step, you can restart it with `mix phx.server`).

**Quick aside: Whats this "eex" stuff?**

`.eex` files are phoenix templates. EEx stands for Embedded Elixir. Phoenix templates are just that, templates into which data can be rendered.

We can interpolate values into our tempalates with syntax like the following:

```elixir
render(conn, "spell.html", spell_name: "Obliviate")
```

```html
<div class="phx-hero">
  <h2>Say good-bye to your memories! <%= @spell_name %>!</h2>
</div>
```

When we use the `render` function in the controller, we're optionally passing in values in as a [keyword list](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/keywords-and-maps.html), which in this case is `[spell_name: "Obliviate"]`. The square brackets aren't syntactically necessary, but are there invisibly. This is pasted into the template between the `<%=` and `%>` by using `@` followed by the varable name.

**Add one more route**

As a mini challenge, add a new route `/spell/:spell_name` where spell name is a url param. When passed into a function in a controller, this will come through as a [map](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/keywords-and-maps.html) like so:

```elixir
def index(conn, %{"spell_name" => spell_name}) do
  # Render a template here
end
```

Everything else you need to know to do this can be found in the template

### 1c Examining our routes

Make sure you're in `apps/fawkes` and run the following command:

```
mix phx.routes
```

What can you see? Hopefully you can see a list of routes for your phoenix app.

These are likely to all be "GET" routes as we're only adding those. When we declare our routes in `router.ex`, we can use all the usual HTTP verbs (`get`, `post`, `put` etc) but there are some other cool Phoenix-specific words too.

Go back to the `router.ex` file. Add the following line:

```
resources "/spells", SpellController
```

Run `mix phx.routes` again. What can you see now?

You should be seeing a LOT more routes. The `resources` keyword automarically generates routes for the following 8 actions:

- `index` (GET)
- `show` (GET)
- `edit` (GET)
- `new` (GET)
- `create` (POST)
- `delete` (DELETE)
- `update` (PUT)
- `update` (PATCH)

For more information on what these actions are intended for, checkout the Phoenix routing guide [here](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/routing.html#resources)

You can exlude it creating certain types of route with:

```elixir
resources "/comments", CommentController, except: [:delete]
```

Or you can get it to only create certain routes with

```elixir
resources "/posts", PostController, only: [:index, :show]
```

**Note:**

So far in examples I've been using `:index` as the controller action, e.g.

```elixir
get "/magic", MagicController, :index
```

However, you're not limited to these keywords, its just convention to use (for example) `:index` for a page.

In an API with loads of routes to the same controller, other words (i.e. function names) might be more appropriate, e.g.

```elixir
get "/subject/:subject", HogwartsController, :subject_info
```

### 1d Scoping

Lets go back to our `router.ex` file and see what's going on with the `scope` keywords.

For example, we've been
